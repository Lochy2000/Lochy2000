## 🚀 About Me
After earning a First-Class degree in Sport Science, I pivoted into tech and have since delivered real-world projects across freelance work, startups, and AI hackathons. I focus on building intuitive UIs, smart workflows, and automation-first platforms.

I’m currently exploring AI-enhanced tooling using multi-agent systems, LLM APIs, and internal dev ops workflows. Open to junior dev roles, especially those involving automation, internal tools, or applied AI.
